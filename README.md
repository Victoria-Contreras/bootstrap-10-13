The index file is for my Restruant Homework 

I used a lot of the content from the example webpage but tried to add some more style elements
I have to say the columns overlap (where I have an img next to text) when you make the live Github webpage smaller I havent figured out how to fix that .
*^ I forgot to put in my media queries 

The Contact page is now a working link.

I tried to make the nave bar sticky but when I put in the class it spread out each anchor.
